                    <h5>PROBLEM</h5>
                    <p class="problemStatement">One of the most effective ways of solving homelessness is through prevention. Front Steps' prioritizes solving homelessness by equipping those experiencing it with resources. Yet, their target users are not utilizing the website as a resource to do so.</p>
                    <h5>SOLUTION</h5>
                    <p>We recommend creating a roadmap to help guide people experiencing homelessness to the resources they need immediately.</p>

                <p>Our team worked with a lot of assumptions until meeting with our stakeholders. We were informed that most of the information on the website needs to be updated. This meant that we were effectively working with a blank slate to breath new life into the site. Below are their top 3 criteria:</p>

                <p>We referred to other non-profit sites as inspiration before sketching. We ended up with two homepage designs, an immediate help page, and a job training page that reflects our user flow. In order to move forward, we conducted an A/B Test on the homepage.</p>

            <img src="../img/portfolio/FrontSteps/FS_ABTesting-21.jpg" alt="A/B Testing. This test looked into how a user percieves context with icons. We thought that more context would provide the user with data they need to move forward. However, we found that multiple uses of the same icon was confusing. There were the same icons on the same page but with different meanings. Ultimately, we moved forward with a condense page view and no icons to prevent confusion." class="portfolioImg">

'Experiencing Homelessness?' was changed to 'Need Help?' to show that we are genuinely invested in helping. Placement of text was moved closer to the rest of the main navigation so that it's easier to find. We also added a page header to 'Immediate Help' to provide the user with page context." class="portfolioImg">

Four main changes were made on the 'Immediate Help' page. 1) Resources were reordered. It turns out that it's easy to find food in Austin, making it a lower priority. 2) Hours of operation are needed since users operate on a resource time table. 3) Our user's eyes are sensitive, so we used a softer white to lessen the contrast. 4) A designated 'Home' button was needed since it's not clear if everyone knows to click on the logo to navigate home." class="portfolioImg">

                <ul>
                    <li>In this redesign, we helped Front Step realign with their organizational goals that will ultimately impact future funding. Good work is well recieved, especially when it's transparent. It speaks to a donor's trust in an organization.  </li>
                    <li>What’s not showcased here is scope creep. We designed more screens in hopes of helping Front Steps realize their vision.</li>
                    <li>This was a difficult project because there are a lot of unknowns with homelessness. A lot of footwork and research were necessary to understand a mental model that’s not as well understood.</li>
                    <li>The next logical step is to see if there's a need for a visual time table to address our users' daily cognitive load.</li>
