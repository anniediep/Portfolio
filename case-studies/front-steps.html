                <h1>Front Steps Website Redesign</h1>
                <p>Front Steps is a non-profit in Austin, TX that focuses on solving homelessness in the greater Austin area. In this project, our design team was enlisted to help redesign their website. </p>

                        <h5>TEAM</h5>
                        <p>Annie Diep, Sebastian Elias, and Judy Nguyen</p>
                        <h5>TOOLS</h5>
                        <p>Miro, Illustrator, Adobe XD, Trello, and G Suite</p>
                        <h5>MY DELIVERABLES</h5>
                        <p>User and Stakeholder Interviews, User Persona, Donor Survey, Empathy Map, Sketches, A/B Testing, Style Guide, and Hi-Fi Prototypes.</p>

                    <h5>PROBLEM</h5>
                    <p>People experiencing homelessness need an easy way to access online resources.</p>
                    <h5>SOLUTION</h5>
                    <p>We did this by redesigning Front Steps’ website so that those in need are taken care of first and guided to the resources they need immediately.</p>
                </div>

                <h5>RESEARCH</h5>
                <p>Collecting data was difficult because we started with assumptions while coordinating a time to meet with a stakeholder. Ultimately, we discovered that our users don’t currently use Front Steps as an online resource and the website needed a complete overhaul.</p>
                <p>Initially, we thought that the website was created for fundraising. Language and content spoke to the things that Front Steps is working to accomplish.</p>

            <div class="textBlock">
                <p>Donations are necessary to keep the operation going, so we sent out a donor survey to understand the motivations behind donating and what drives repeat donations.</p>

            <div class="textBlock">
                <p>Our team acted on a hunch and conducted user interviews downtown and talked to a surprisingly diverse spread of people experiencing homelessness. We would learn that they're our target users, below are the most important things to them.</p>
            </div>
            <img src="../img/portfolio/FrontSteps/FS_UserInsights-17.png" alt="Insights" class="portfolioImg">
            <div class="textBlock">
                <p>From our stakeholder meeting, we learned more about Front Steps and got a better understanding of their vision for their website.</p>

            <div class="textBlock">
                <h5>DEFINITION</h5>
                <p>We synthesized our data and created a couple documents that allowed us to better empathize with the user such as a user persona. </p>
            </div>
            <img src="../img/portfolio/FrontSteps/Hugh-01.png" alt="User Persona" class="portfolioImg">
            <div class="textBlock">
                <p>Since people experiencing homelessness are the target users we wanted to make navigation as straightforward as possible. By putting the resources upfront and making it more consumable, they should be easier to find by SEO optimization. </p>

                <h3>Conclusion & Next Steps</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>All of our users said that they would use our website if they were ever met with homelessness.</li>
                    <li>What’s not showcased here is scope creep. We actually designed more pages in hopes of helping Front Steps implement changes to their website.</li>
                    <li>This was a difficult project since there are a lot of unknowns when it comes to homelessness. Lot of footwork and research were necessary to understand a mental model that’s not well understood.</li>
                    <li>Moving forward, I would like to design the checklist provided to families that are looking for a loved one.</li>
