                    <h5>PROBLEM</h5>
                    <p class="problemStatement">For a variety of reasons, people are choosing to live in smaller more efficient spaces, often renting over buying a home, which means they have less space to store things. They wish they could rent instead of buying items that they have limited use for.</p>
                    <h5>SOLUTION</h5>
                    <p>We created a peer-to-peer rental platform that encourages community engagement and eco-friendly practices. Additional focus was placed on ease of use for searching and renting items.</p>

                <p>We interviewed 5 users, 1 business, and sent out a survey. The goal was to learn more about the concept of renting over buying.</p>

            </div>
            <img src="../img/portfolio/Trellis/JaneStevens.png" alt="User Persona showcasing Jane Stevens. She's a tax account that is saving for a home and paying off college debt.

                    <p>When you can rent anything from a community, what does that mean? We explored categorizing different items to cover our categories wholistically. Two items, in particular, gave us the most headaches: a ladder and a stroller.</p>

                <div class="separatorH"></div>
                <p>After creating our wireframes we tested our user flow. Users had no issues completing the task. However, there were some concerns raised that we addressed below.</p>
            </div>
            <img src="../img/portfolio/Trellis/UserTest1-11.png" alt="Iteration 1: Users had no issues navigating the flow. Instead we caught items that would make the flow more realistic like the cost of the renting the drill per day, giving the user feedback from a button interaction, rethinking delivery options, adding a rough distance for delivery, and providing a chat system to communicate with the owner of the item." class="portfolioImg">
            <figcaption>Testing and Iteration on the User Flow</figcaption>
            <div class="textBlock">
                <p>We were curious about whether people would impulse rent items. And debated the importance of transparency and maximizing above-the-fold content.</p>

            <img src="../img/portfolio/Trellis/ABTesting-13.jpg" alt="A/B Testing testing the validity of condensing info to be above the fold versus having to scroll for information.

            <div class="textBlock">
                <p>We continued testing and refining the flow. Below you can see the results based on the feedback on delivery.</p>

            <img src="../img/portfolio/Trellis/MessagesForDelivery-15.png" alt="Iteration 2: Delivery Option. We quickly learned that having the delivery option of the rental item on it's product page was unrealistic. This is the nature of rapid prototyping. Our solution was to create an additional screen 'Messages' to create a channel to gain clarity in arranging delivery, ask the lender questions, inform the user of the rental period, extend rental period, and manage payments." class="portfolioImg">

                        <li>This project was a success. We identified a gap in the U.S. market that hasn’t been tapped yet. Trellis supports a circular economy of reusing resources. From a business perspective, there's little to maintain outside of logistics. Overall, a great return in business value that has buy-in from both rentees and renters.</li>
                    <li>This was a great team to work with. We had some healthy internal debates about aspects of our design and made good use of whiteboards, windows, and sticky notes to work through our design challenges. </li>
                    <li>We found ourselves with many parking lot items. The next logical step is to look into improving the categorization of products, especially clothing and luxury items.</li>
                    <li>Given more time, I would build out the last responsive page in the flow.</li>
