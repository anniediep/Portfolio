                <h1>Travis County Homepage Redesign</h1>
                <p>Travis County's mission is to improve the quality of life for the people of Travis County: items like providing justice, health, and safety services. In this redesign, I focused on improving awareness of services and community engagement.</p>

                    <h5>PROBLEM</h5>
                    <p class="problemStatement">Travis County provides many services for their citizens, however, citizens in their late twenties or younger have no idea why they would visit the Travis County webpage.</p>
                    <p class="quote">“How might we bring more awareness to the services and resources provided by Travis County while embodying the vision of innovation and a vibrant community?”</p>
                    <h5>SOLUTION</h5>
                    <p>I redesigned the website to model a warm conversation that encourages community engagement. This was accomplished by</p> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reorganizing the high level site map</li>
                        <li>Answering who, what, when, where, and how</li>
                        <li>Adding breathing room</li>
                        <li>Brand refresh</li>

        <div class="section oddBlock"> <!--Research-->
            <div class="textBlock">
                <h5>RESEARCH</h5>
                <p>I surveyed 7 people. While the turnout is not ideal, it's not terrible for getting a quick subset in a short span of time.</p>
            </div>
            <img src="../img/portfolio/TravisCounty/Insight-01.png" alt="Biggest take-away: The overwhemling response showed that those in their late twenties or younger didn't know why they would want to even visit Travis County's website.

            <div class="textBlock">
                <p>A red-line analysis helped me understand how information architecture came across to the homepage's visitors. What I quickly realized was that there is a lack of visual priority and a lot of information with little direction. Not bad, but could be better.</p>

        <div class="section"> <!--Definition-->
            <div class="textBlock">
                <h5>DEFINITION</h5>
                <p>One thing I really wanted to be mindful of was that this website is for everyone. That means taking care of current users (those 30 and up) and bringing on those who don't currently see the county's value (late 20's and younger).</p>
                <h3>The Approach</h3>
                <div class="separatorH"></div>
                <p>I saw the easiest way to create the site architecture as one where you walk into a building and have a conversation with the helpful receptionist. There are a couple buckets that cover what a person might ask.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I want to...</li>
                    <li>What services would help me...?</li>
                    <li>Which department...?/ I'm looking for ... department.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Rapid Prototyping</h3>
                <div class="separatorH"></div>
                <p>I sketched out a couple ideas. Going in I knew I would end up with 2 expanded tab views and outlined the flow of the homepage. It made the most sense to do rapid prototyping to quickly figure out which approach worked best for each section of the homepage.</p>

                <p>Our team thought it was important to create a simple, clean design. Even more so because Trellis will be full of photos of all kinds of rental items. We chose green to touch on the environmental friendly aspect of Trellis.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>This project was a success. When testing with users in their late twenties or younger, they found that the redesign addressed their questions about Travis County as they explored the homepage.</li>
                    <li>I would love to actually sit down and figure out how to showcase the services provided.</li>
                    <li>I took away the most visibility from business resources that use to be a navigation link and it may need more attention moving forward.</li>
