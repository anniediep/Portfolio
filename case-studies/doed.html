                <h1>The U.S. Department of Education Website Redesign</h1>
                <p>The U.S. Department of Education (DoED) is an organization whose mission is to promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness. In this personal project, I redesign their website to match the mental model of a student.</p>

                        <p>Annie Diep - Personal Project</p>
                        <h5>TOOLS</h5>
                        <p>Miro, Illustrator, Adobe XD, Trello, and G Suite</p>

                <div>
                    <h5>PROBLEM</h5>
                    <p>The DoED site as-is has a ton of information but no centralized focus, making navigation difficult for a student looking to lower the cost of their tuition.</p>
                    <h5>SOLUTION</h5>
                    <p>I did this by creating a roadmap, restructuring the content and messaging of the site so that navigation is clear and the content doesn’t overwhelm the user. Additionally, I updated the branding to reflect the organization.</p>
                </div>

            <div class="textBlock">
                <h5>RESEARCH</h5>
                <p>I learned that students are overwhelmed while searching for grants and scholarships on the DoED’s website. From the data collected from my user interviews and accessibility, these are the insights I gathered. </p>
            </div>
            <img src="#" alt="User Insights" class="portfolioImg">
            <div class="textBlock">
                <p>From my own research I could understand why students were frustrated with finding that the grants that applied to them. There's a lack of focus and way too much information.</p>
            </div>
            <img src="#" alt="Red-lining" class="portfolioImg">
            <div class="textBlock">
                <p>Additionally, I looked into accessibility. It’s even more crucial since the DoED’s mission is to give equal access to students.</p>

        <div class="section"> <!--Definition-->
            <div class="textBlock">
                <h5>DEFINITION</h5>
                <p>In the next step of the design process, I created documents that help keep me aligned to the goals set with consideration to the insights collected. One item being the user persona, which helped me empathize with the user.</p>
            </div>
            <img src="#" alt="User Persona" class="portfolioImg">
            <div class="textBlock">
                <p>Card Sorting was necessary to sort through all the information housed on DoED. It helped give me clarity in organizing the contents of the site. </p>
            </div>
            <img src="#" alt="Card Sort" class="portfolioImg">
            <div class="textBlock">
                <p>Helping a user navigate to finding funding for their tuition through a user flow helped me focus on the task at hand. I chose to focus on applying for federal grants. </p>

        <div class="section oddBlock"> <!--Iteration-->
            <div class="textBlock">
                <h5>ITERATION</h5>
                <p>I put some wire frames together and conducted a 5 second test. These quick test helped identify mental disconnects with a student. The biggest changes were made in the dropdown, sub-level navigation, and highlighting the Pell Grant.</p>
            </div>
            <img src="#" alt="Iteration" class="portfolioImg">
            <div class="textBlock">
                <h3>Style Guide</h3>
                <p>Colors were pulled from the logo to create a simple color pallet for the style guide. I wanted to keep screens clean and have images that convey proper imagery that's serious yet playful.</p>

                <h3>Iterating over Hi-Fi</h3>
                <p>Users had no issues navigating to where they wanted to go. What was surprising was just the concept of what is clickable and what wasn't. Below are the changes made.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion & Next Steps</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Users liked my design and said they would use this website.</li>
                    <li>I was surprised by the confusion on what is clickable and what isn't. It's humbling when I thought it was obvious but I was too close to the product.</li>
                    <li>It's significantly faster to design if you work from the style guide.</li>
                    <li>I think the next difficult but necessary area to design is the Student Loans page. It would be interesting to see how to best integrate a login from an external website.</li>
