                <h1>A Peer-to-Peer Rental Platform</h1>
                <p class="shorten">Trellis came from our team's mutual love for the library and the idea of sharing. A library's impact on any given community is significant in terms of accessibility, cost, flexibility, and more. We wanted to take it further and offer a solution that allows communities to take advantage of its available resources through rentals.</p>

                <h5>RESEARCH</h5>
                <p>To better understand the market, we conducted research: five user interviews, one interview with a business, and surveyed our network. We then pulled data points from our interview transcripts to create an affinity map. The biggest take-aways are in the diagram below.</p>

                <p>To bring this idea to life, we created a user persona for our renter, one that aligns with our interviews and insights. Meet Jane Stevens.</p>

                <p>We recognized the importance of structure in our web app, particularly when it comes down to categories. A site that has the potential to house anything needs order, so we did a card sort to nail it down. We tested groupings, and we tried out categories. Two items gave the most headaches because of the different interpretations people had: a ladder and a stroller. In the end, we came up with Household, Outdoors, Tools, Luxury, Electronics, and Baby & Pets.</p>

            <img src="../img/portfolio/Trellis/UserTest1-11.png" alt="Iteration 1: Users had no issues navigating the flow.

            <figcaption>Testing and Iteration on the User Flow</figcaption>
            <div class="textBlock">

                <div class="separatorH"></div>
                <ul>
                    <li>This project was a success. We identified a gap in the U.S. market that hasn’t been tapped yet. Trellis supports a circular economy of reusing resources. From a business perspective, there's little to maintain outside of logistics. Overall, a great return in business value that has buy-in from both rentees and renters.</li>
                    <li>This was a great team to work with. We had some healthy internal debates about aspects of our design and made good use of whiteboards, windows, and sticky notes to work through our design challenges. </li>
                    <li>We found ourselves with many parking lot items. The next logical step is to look into improving the categorization of products, especially clothing and luxury items.</li>
                    <li>Given more time, I would build out the last responsive page in the flow.</li>
