                        <p>Annie Diep & Grant Specht</p>
                        <h5>TOOLS</h5>
                        <p>Miro, Illustrator, Adobe XD, Trello, and G Suite</p>

                    <h5>PROBLEM</h5>
                    <p>Millennials are always on the go, they need a solution to manage their recipes and make cooking easier.</p>
                    <h5>SOLUTION</h5>
                    <p>We did this by creating a recipe management system that imports recipes from the web and digitizing recipes that have been passed down. Additionally, cooking is a process and we want to empower our users with tools so they can focus on actually cooking.</p>

        <div class="section"> <!--Research-->
            <div>
                <h5>RESEARCH</h5>
                <p>Through user interviews and surveys, we discovered that our users currently don’t have a good solution for managing their recipes.  In an effort to stay focused, we synthesised our data to concise points that would guide us through this process. Below are the 5 main takeaways.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>Our users primarily turned to browser bookmarks and paper copies, below are our indirect competitors in our competitive analysis.</p>

                <h5>DEFINITION</h5>
                <p>We created a user persona from the insights we gathered to help us empathize with our user and further guide us in our design process.</p>
            </div>
            <img src="../img/portfolio/RecipeTin/JuliaPersona-01.png" alt="User Persona" class="portfolioImg">
            <div>
                <p>Next we took the opportunities identified from our competitive analysis and prioritized our features based on the user’s needs and motivations.</p>
            </div>
            <img src="../img/portfolio/RecipeTin/RT_solution-05.png" alt="Feature Prioritization" class="portfolioImg">
            <div>
                <p>A user flow diagram gave us a big picture view of RecipeTin. From this we quickly learned that our homepage would house our categories, bookmarked recipes, and call to action.</p>

                <h5>ITERATION</h5>
                <h3>Sketches and Wireframes</h3>
                <p>Sketches allowed us to quickly ideate different ways a user could flow through screens and identify gaps before moving to wireframes. For instance:</p>
            </div>
            <img src="../img/portfolio/RecipeTin/RT_QuickTest-10.png" alt="Quick Test" class="portfolioImg">

            <img src="../img/portfolio/RecipeTin/Sketches2.JPG" alt="Sketches" class="portfolioImg">
            <div>
                <p>Below are our wireframes with 2 scenarios:</p>
            </div>
            <img src="../img/portfolio/RecipeTin/RT_WireFlow1-08.png" alt="Wireframe Flow 1" class="portfolioImg">
            <img src="../img/portfolio/RecipeTin/RT_WireFlow2-09.png" alt="Wireframe Flow 2" class="portfolioImg">
            <div>
                <h5>Testing & Improvements</h5>
                <p>After wireframing, we asked our users to perform a series of tasks. In these user tests we asked our users to: add a recipe you’d like to try from Bon Appetit, add a recipe that was passed down, create a shopping list, etc.</p>
                <p>Much to our surprise, we had the most problems with the menu.</p>
            </div>
            <img src="../img/portfolio/RecipeTin/RT_Iteration-06.png" alt="Iteration" class="portfolioImg">
            <div>
                <p>There were a couple more minor adjustments made but they were all related to mapping in the prototype.</p>
                <h5>Hi-Fi Prototype</h5>
                <p>Our team decided to keep RecipeTin simple and clean with a calm blue and a pop of orange in our High-Fidelity Prototype.</p>

            <h5>REFLECTION</h5>
            <h3>Conclusion & Next Steps</h3>
            <li>
                <ul>Users informed us that they would use our app.</ul>
                <ul>People want ease and convenience when it comes to searching for recipes. This should be the guiding compass as improvements and features are made. </ul>
                <ul>Moving forward, we’d like to allow users to import recipes via a photo in order to digitize their recipe.</ul>
                <ul>We would also like to open this app up to a platform where users can share recipes with their friends and family.</ul>
