            <p>My name is Annie Diep. I’m an Austin native, a creative, an engineer, a nature lover, a foodie, a yogi, a Longhorn, and a UX Designer. </p>
            <p>I'm here because of the experiences that make up my past. Below is a quick overview of me and how I got here. The intersection of creativity, logic, and genuine connection lead me to pursue UX.</p>
            <img src="img/about-me/vendiagram-03.png" alt="vendiagram showcasing me as the intersection of logic, genuine connection, and creativity" class="visual">
            <p>As a tech consultant, I was always frustrated that I wasn't able to talk directly to the users. They were always out of reach and business analysts acted as their microphone. That's not the same as talking to them directly. Doing so would add clarity to their daily struggles, goals, and perspective so I can best help. That's not to say that good work wasn't done, but it took longer to get there.</p>
            <p>The turning point for me was realizing how I wanted to grow and spend my time. I love helping people, logic problems, and having a creative outlet. Going into UX was a natural next step.</p>
            <p>I believe that information should be accessible and design should reflect the ease of accessibility and ultimately be usable. The form this materializes in is unique across the board depending on the users, the business, and available resources. I enjoy learning and understanding how to bring these aspects together to create seamless products that are an extension of the user.</p>
            <p>In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with my friends and family, traveling, and taking a deep dive into my latest obsession.</p>
            <p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
